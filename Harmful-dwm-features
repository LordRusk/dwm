Harmfull
-------
This is an incomplete list of patchs and
settings in dwm that are harmful and go
against a suckless, efficent, and minimalist
workflow.

If you want to do a quick check of whether something
is harmful, I've given a few over arching values.
  1: Is it wasting space?
    Y: Then it's harmful.

The farther left something is, the more harmful it is.
If there is no alternative given, its so harmful it does
not need a replacement.
